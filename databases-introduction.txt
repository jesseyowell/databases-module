> Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database would be used if you have to make information persist through the program (i.e. more than once instance of an application running with updated data). A text file would be used to import data, or information for a program but not necessary for the information to persist beyond that session.

> Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is considered a declarative language, it's concerned on what to find in the database, rather than how to find it. We don't want write algorithms on how to find our data, we trust the database will determine how to find it for us.  

In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

Data is entered in a database that may have similar features. Each column in a database represents some description of what is stored in it. The row of a database is a grouped piece of information that may represent something: a transaction, a user's information, or inventory. Used together, we can query, or update information that is stored within these columns and rows.


Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

table = a data structure used to describe a piece of information, together with rows, columns and values.
row = grouped information for a particular piece of data
column = used to describe the data 
value = the information contained within the column
